# Boilerplate (No Auth)

</div>

## About

This will be a boilerplate that makes use of backend, frontend, and redux; but it will not use any authentication. This repository is intended to be a template for any future projects, working as a jump off point for the initial project structure. It will already have the basic necessary configurations and anything further installed would be specific to the project goal.

## Technologies Used

- Express(version 4.18.2): configuration for handling requests/server responses, route handling, static file handling, error handling, etc. on the backend
- Morgan (version 1.10.0): middleware configuration for logging details regarding requests/responses
